# Requirements specification

## Purpose of the application

The overall purpose of the application is to offer users a way to keep all their recipes in a single place,
instead of having them spread out over a range of sources, including various physical cookbooks & blog posts,
and notes containing recipies for the users very own secret sauces. In essence, the user experience would be a digital recipe book 
where they could keep all their favorite recipes.

A digital implementation will additionally allow users to not only look up specific recipes, but the range of 
recipes containing specific ingredients - a useful function, e.g. for checking what you at that moment could 
make based on the ingredients you happen to have at home.

People also tend to deviate from original recipes. E.g. some hate garlic and leave it out, others love it
and add it to everything. Some might try vegeterian adaptations of traditional meat recipes, others need to
adapt a recipe because of intolerance to a certain ingredient. Thus, the app will strive to allow users to be able 
to have the recipes THEY need, not just those according to someone else's instructions.


## Users

The core application is primarily aimed at single users, for whom the app offers a custom tailored recipe book, 
which they themselves build up as they add to it over time.


## Draft of user interface

TBA


## Functinality of core application

- User can add new recipes (Feature implemented),
- User can "open"/see/use recipes,
- User can edit recipes,
- User can delete recipes,
- User can list/see overview of all recipes,
- User can search for recipes;
	- by name,
	- by ingredients.



## Restrictions on application

- The application must work on the Linux- & OSX desktop, 
- The application cannot be dependent on an internet connection to work,
- All app data will be saved locally on device.


## Future development

- Categorize recipes, and search for recipes based on category - e.g. "fish",

**Would require transition from purely "offline" state:**
- Sync personal recipes accross devices,
- Make recipes public to other users to see,
- Search for/browse public recipes by other users,
- Send/Share recipies to other users,
